# Current Events Automator

A program made to automate the current events assignments from a certain history class using web scraping and ChatGPT.

# Requirements

- Python3
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4
- Google Chrome
- [humanTyper](https://github.com/saadejazz/humanTyper)

# Tutorial

Coming soon.

# Current Functionality

Currently, current-events-auto is able to:

- get the latest CNN article
- use the ChatGPT website in order to have it generate a one paragraph summary for said article

# Planned Functionality

In the future, the ideal flow would be:
- current-events-auto running automatically using Windows Task Manager or cron 
- picking the latest article from the past week from CNN or another website 
- using this article to have ChatGPT write a summary, opinion, and question, 
- opening the Google Doc for the correct assignment and using humanTyper to simulate realistic typing to avoid detection
- handing in the assignment automatically after current-events-auto is done writing out the results
