# Current Events Automator

A program made to automate the current events assignments from a certain history class using web scraping and ChatGPT.

# Requirements

- Python3
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4
- Google Chrome
- [humanTyper](https://github.com/saadejazz/humanTyper)

# Tutorial

Coming soon.

# Current Functionality

Currently, current-events-auto is able to get text from a CNN article, then use the ChatGPT website in order to have it generate a one paragraph summary for said article. 

# Planned Functionality

In the future, the ideal flow would be current-events-auto running automatically using Windows Task Manager or cron, picking the latest article from the past week from CNN or another website, using this article to have ChatGPT write a summary, opinion, and question, then opening the Google Doc for the assignment and using humanTyper to simulate realistic typing to avoid detection. That's still a long ways off though!
